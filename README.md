# Significance of Gradient in Time-Series Analysis

The gradient, or rate of change, in time-series analysis is highly significant for multiple reasons:
1. **Trend Identification**: Gradients reveal whether data is trending upward or downward over time. 
   Positive gradients indicate increases, while negative gradients show decreases.
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Sharp changes in the gradient may indicate anomalies or unusual patterns, such as 
   sudden spikes or drops in glucose levels.
3. **Predictive Analysis**: Understanding the rate of change can improve the accuracy of predictive models by 
   showing how data is likely to evolve over time.
4. **Machine Learning Input**: Gradients can be used as features in machine learning models for time-series 
   data to capture trends beyond raw values.

# Gradient Analysis

![Glucose Gradient Plot](https://github.com/acp18ab/Gradient-Analysis/blob/main/glucose_gradient_plot_days.jpg?raw=true)

This graph shows daily glucose levels (blue line) and their rate of change (red dashed line) over a 10-day period. The glucose level line shows how the values increase, decrease, or stabilize each day. The gradient line, which represents the rate of change, indicates whether glucose levels are rising (positive gradient) or falling (negative gradient) from one day to the next. Together, these lines provide a clear view of how glucose levels fluctuate and the speed of those changes across the days.
